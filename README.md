#WeatherWatch

The provided Python code is a small script that fetches weather data for a specific city and announces the current temperature using text-to-speech (TTS) technology. It also tells the user the time of the day (morning, evening, night, or early morning) based on the current time. The weather data is obtained through the OpenWeatherMap API, and the text-to-speech functionality is achieved using the pyttsx3 library.
